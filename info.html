            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Bad posture isn’t always a sign of laziness. As a nation, weight issues are becoming more common, and                      weight gain changes how our skeleton and muscles support themselves. We also tend to be less active,                      which can lead to increased risk of disease. Chairs, hunching at work, unsupportive mattresses, and                        even low self-esteem contribute to these problems.</p>
            <p>Symptoms of poor posture can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rounded Shoulders</li>
                <li>Potbelly</li> 
                <li>Bent knees when standing or walking</li> 
                <li>Head that either leans forward or backward</li> 
                <li>Back pain</li> 
                <li>Body aches and pains</li> 
                <li>Muscle fatigue</li> 
                <li>Headache</li> 
            </ul>

          <div class="scrollsection" id="neck">    
            <h1>Neck</h1>
            <p>Forward Head Posture (FHP) can be recognised by the positioning of the ear being forward of the shoulder, rather than sitting directly over it. Poor neck posture leads to a Forward Head Position which is one of the most common causes of neck, head and shoulder tension and pain. This can be a result of long term habits of “slumping” at the computer, whilst driving, sitting poorly on the couch, or poor sleeping posture. These habits can be worsened if strains and sprains of the neck have occurred in the past which has weakened the neck muscles.</p>
              <p>
              For every inch your head posture sits forward, the head gains 4.5kgs (10 pounds) in weight. This forces the muscles in your upper back and neck to work much harder to keep the head (chin) from dropping forwards onto your chest.</p>
              <p>
              Forward head posture is a very common issue and is estimated to occur between 66% and 90% of the population.  It has been linked to various health problems including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Decreased respiratory muscle strength</li>
                <li>Reduced lung capacity</li> 
                <li>Tension-type headaches</li> 
                <li>Psychological and mental disorders</li> 
            </ul>

            <h1>Upper Spine</h1>
            <p>Exaggerated curvature of the spine as in the “hunchback” posture is termed kyphosis. There are several factors that can lead to this unnatural curvature, including excessive amounts of time in poor seated positions (couch/office chair); muscular imbalances through the posterior chain (including spinal muscles, gluteal muscles and neck) and of course ‘stooping’ — a problem mainly with tall people who have to constantly orient their head downwards to interact with others and their environment.</p>
              <p>The spine is under a tremendous amount of pressure to maintain an upright posture. Muscles of the neck must be strong and properly balanced in order to keep the head in a stable upright position. </p>

            <h1>Lower Spine</h1>
            <p>Lordosis, also known as swayback, is a condition in which the spine in the lower back has an excessive curvature. The spine naturally curves at the neck, upper back, and lower back to help absorb shock and support the weight of the head. Lordosis occurs when the natural arch in the lower back, or lumbar region, curves more than normal. This can lead to excess pressure on the spine, causing pain.</p>
              <p>
              The easiest way to check for lordosis is to lie on your back on a hard surface. You should be able to slide your hand under your lower back, with little space to spare. If you have lordosis, you will have extra space between your hand and your low back.</p>
              
              <p>
              For most people, lordosis does not cause significant health problems if left untreated. However, since the spine is responsible for much of our movement and flexibility, it is important to maintain a healthy spine. Not treating lordosis could lead to an increased risk of problems with the spine, hip girdle, legs, and internal organs.</p>

            <h1>Pelvis</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Anterior pelvic tilt is when the front of the pelvis drops and the back of the pelvis rises. This happens when the hip flexors shorten and the hip extensors lengthen.</li>
                <li>Posterior pelvic tilt is the opposite, when the front of the pelvis rises and the back of the pelvis drops. This happens when the hip flexors lengthen and the hip extensors shorten, particularly the gluteus maximus which is the primary hyperextensor of the hip.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Anterior pelvic tilt is caused by increased lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis, stretched abdominal muscles, tightened hip flexors while Posterior pelvic tilt is caused by sway back and thoracic kyphosis, stretched flexors and lower abdominal muscles and tightened hamstrings.</p>
              
              <p>
              As a result of pelvic tilt, people will generally have added stress on the low back joints and spine, causing pain, inflammation, spasm and tenderness.</p>

            <h1>Knees</h1>
              <p>
              When sitting, your knees should be bent at a right angle, slightly higher than the hips. Your ankles should be slightly forward of your knees. According to the Cleveland Clinic, crossing your legs places harmful pressure on your spine and legs and should be avoided. Body weight should be distributed equally on both sides and your feet should be flat on the floor. Knees also should be slightly higher than your hips when driving.</p>
            <p>The posture of the knees is especially important when bending and lifting heavy items. The effects of poor knee posture when lifting can be serious and can cause back sprain and spinal pressure. The back should remain straight with knees and hips bent to pick up objects from a position lower than your waist. Keep feet and knees spread to at least shoulder-width apart to maintain balance and avoid locking the knees. When lifting items from a table at waist-height, bend the knees slightly to take pressure off your back.</p>

            <h1>Feet</h1>
            <p>Putting too much weight on one foot, leaning too much forward, and even turning your feet outward or inward while standing (they should be pointing forward) could mess up other parts of your body. Do this for too long (for example, at a standing desk or if you stand a lot on your feet), and it's a hard habit to correct.</p>
              
              <p>
              Proper foot alignment can cause an array of problems including, back pain, sciatica, sacral joint pain, sway back, hip joint pain, posture problems, tightness in the joints and muscles from the legs to the back, disc bulges, knee pain, osteoarthritis, pelvic imbalance, piriformis syndrome and even headaches. And that is not including problems that can occur with the actual feet themselves.</p>
